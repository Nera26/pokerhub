# Engineering Collaboration Guide

This document outlines processes to ensure teams align on design, quality, and long-term maintainability.

## RFC Process

- Draft proposals in `docs/rfcs` with background, design details, and migration strategy.
- Share drafts in team channels for early feedback.
- Record decisions and follow-up items before merging.

## Migration Guides

- Create step-by-step guides in `docs/migrations` when introducing breaking changes.
- Include timelines, code examples, and automated checks to ease adoption.
- Track completion across teams and update guides as blockers surface.

## Code Review Mentorship

- Pair new contributors with experienced reviewers.
- Encourage reviewers to explain reasoning and reference style guides.
- Link to relevant RFCs or migration guides when requesting changes.

## Incident Postmortems

- Document incidents within 48 hours using a blameless format.
- Highlight root causes, mitigations, and follow-up tasks.
- Share summaries in common channels to broadcast lessons learned.

## Cross-Team Standards

- Maintain shared conventions in `docs/standards` for tooling and style.
- Review standards quarterly to ensure they remain relevant.
- Track adoption metrics (e.g., lint rule compliance, migration completion) to gauge effectiveness.
