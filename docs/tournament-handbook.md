# Tournament Handbook

This handbook standardizes how PokerHub hosts competitive events.

## Formats

- **Freezeout** – Each player gets one entry; elimination ends participation.
- **Rebuy/Add‑On** – Players may repurchase chips during a defined window or add more at break.
- **Progressive Knockout** – Buy‑in split between prize pool and bounty that grows when a player is eliminated.
- **Satellite** – Awards seats or tickets to higher buy‑in events instead of cash.

## Payout Rules

- Prize pool equals `(entries × buy‑in) − rake` unless a guarantee exceeds it.
- Payout tables are published before start and locked once registration closes.
- Standard tables pay ~15% of the field using a top‑heavy distribution.
- Bounty events return half of the buy‑in as knock‑out rewards.

## Examples
