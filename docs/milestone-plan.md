# Milestone Plan

This roadmap outlines eight major steps for PokerHub's development.

1. **Hand Engine v1** – implement the initial version of the engine that deals cards, evaluates hands, and resolves pots.
2. **Socket Reliability** – harden WebSocket connections with reconnection logic, heartbeats, and message ordering.
3. **RNG Commit–Reveal** – ensure fair randomness with a cryptographic commit–reveal scheme for shuffles.
4. **Wallet & Rake** – integrate on-chain/off-chain wallets, handle deposits/withdrawals, and apply rake policies.
5. **Tournament Core** – build tournament structures, table balancing, and progression logic.
6. **Leaderboards** – surface player rankings across cash games and tournaments.
7. **Observability** – add metrics, tracing, and alerting to monitor system health.
8. **Scale & Chaos** – stress test the platform and introduce chaos engineering to validate resilience.
