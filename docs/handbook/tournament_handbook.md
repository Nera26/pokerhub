## Formats

- **Freezeout** – one life per player.
- **Rebuy/Add‑On** – additional chips allowed until a level cut‑off.
- **Progressive Knockout** – half of each buy‑in funds a bounty that grows when players collect others'.
- **Satellite** – prizes are seats to target events.

## Blinds

- Starting stacks target 100 big blinds.
- Levels advance on a schedule (e.g., 10 minutes standard, 5 minutes turbo).
- Antes begin when blinds reach 200/400.

## Payout Rules

- Prize pool = `(entries × buy‑in) − rake` unless a guarantee exceeds it.
- Tables pay roughly 15% of the field using a top‑heavy distribution.
- Bounty events return half the buy‑in as knock‑out rewards.

## Example

### 10‑Player Freezeout

| Place | Payout % | Amount (100 buy‑in) |
|------:|---------:|--------------------:|
| 1     | 50%      | $500 |
| 2     | 30%      | $300 |
| 3     | 20%      | $200 |

## Reconciliation

Event ledger entries are verified daily. See the [Reconciliation Guide](reconciliation_guide.md) for procedures.
