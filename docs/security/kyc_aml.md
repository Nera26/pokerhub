# KYC/AML Onboarding and Enforcement

This document describes how PokerHub verifies player identities and enforces anti-money laundering controls.

## Onboarding Flow
1. **Registration** – collect legal name, date of birth, and country.
2. **Document Upload** – players submit government ID and proof of address.
3. **Sanctions Screening** – data checked against OFAC and EU watchlists.
4. **Risk Scoring** – automated checks assign a risk level.
5. **Approval** – low-risk accounts are activated automatically; higher risk requires manual review.

## Ongoing Monitoring
- Periodic rescreening of active accounts.
- Transaction monitoring for large deposits or rapid chip transfers.
- Device and geolocation changes trigger re-verification.

## Enforcement
- Suspicious activity freezes the account and notifies compliance.
- Confirmed AML violations result in account closure and reporting to regulators.
- Audit logs retained for **5 years**.
