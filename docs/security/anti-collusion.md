# Anti-Collusion Monitoring

PokerHub uses behavioral analysis and auditing to detect players collaborating unfairly.

## Heuristics
- **Shared IP or Device Fingerprints**: Flag players repeatedly joining tables from the same network or hardware.
- **Synchronized Betting Patterns**: Detect coordinated timing or identical wager sequences.
- **Chip Dumping**: Monitor rapid transfers of chips between the same accounts.
- **Unusual Win Rates**: Identify players with statistically improbable results against specific opponents.
- **Table Selection**: Track groups entering and leaving tables together.

## Audit Procedures
1. **Daily Review**: Compliance team reviews heuristic alerts and crossâ€‘checks game logs.
2. **Hand History Analysis**: Use automated tools to replay flagged hands and confirm collusion.
3. **Account Linking**: Investigate IP logs, device IDs, and payment methods for shared attributes.
4. **Player Interviews**: Reach out to involved accounts for explanations when evidence is inconclusive.
5. **Enforcement**: Suspend accounts, confiscate funds, and notify regulators if collusion is confirmed.
6. **Record Keeping**: Retain investigation records for **5 years** in secure storage.
