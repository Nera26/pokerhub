## Alerts

## Playbook
1. Review the workflow logs in GitHub Actions to confirm the absence of proofs.
2. Inspect the database to ensure hands are being recorded with seeds and nonces.
3. Resolve the underlying issue and [rerun the workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows) once proofs are available.
